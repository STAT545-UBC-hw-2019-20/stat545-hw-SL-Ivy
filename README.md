## About me
My name is Ivy Li. I am currently a Master's student studying food microbiology in the Food Science program. I am particularly interested in a foodbrone pathogen called _Campylobacter_, a group of pink, cut, **picky** bacteria! <br>
In my spare time (~~though as a graduate student, I shouldn't have much spare time! LOL~~:bowtie:), I like cooking, baking, and cycling.
