## Goal

The goal of this homework is to solidify the data wrangling skills by working some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.
`gapminder` data frame will be used to practice the data reshaping and table joins.



## Setup the working environment for the data analysis
Make sure `gapminder`, `tidyverse`, and `DT` packages are installed.
Load them with the following code:

```r
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

## Exercise 1: Univariate Data Reshaping

The Exercise 1 and 2 need to use the date frame `gapminder`. It would be better to check the structure of this data frame before we get start.

```r
gapminder
```

```

## Exercise 3: Table Joins 
* First, we need to load the data for this practice session.
Read in the made-up wedding guestlist and email addresses using the following lines:


```r
guest <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/attend.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   party = col_double(),
##   name = col_character(),
##   meal_wedding = col_character(),
##   meal_brunch = col_character(),
##   attendance_wedding = col_character(),
##   attendance_brunch = col_character(),
##   attendance_golf = col_character()
## )
```

```r
email <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/emails.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   guest = col_character(),
##   email = col_character()
## )
```

After load the data, we can check the data by calling their assigned name.
* The guest 

```r
guest
```

```

#### Exercise 3.1: For each guest in the guestlist (guest tibble), add a column for email address, which can be found in the email tibble.

It can be found that the in the `email` tibble, there are mutiple guest sharing one email address, but all the other guests' information stored in the guest tibble are based on the individual guest.
Also, the column name in `email` that stores the guests' name is called *guest* other than *name* in the `guest`.
In order to join two tibbles, the variables in the `email` tibble need to be reshaped and renamed to match the `guest` tibble.
Each name in the same row is separated by ", ", so we can split one row based on this `sep=", ". **Pay attention to the space after the comma**


```r
email_shaped <- email %>% 
  separate_rows(guest, sep = ", ") %>%
  rename(name = guest)%>%
  as_tibble()
```

To add the email for each guest in the `guest` tibble


```r
guest  %>%
  left_join(email_shaped, by = "name")
```

```

Those are the three guests that somehow haven't been added to the guestlist.

#### Exercise 3.3: Make a guestlist that includes everyone we have emails for (in addition to those on the original guestlist).

guest_new <-guest %>%
  full_join(email_shaped, by = "name")
DT::datatable(guest_new)
```
