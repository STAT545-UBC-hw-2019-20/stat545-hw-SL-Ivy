## Goal

The goal of this homework is to solidify the data wrangling skills by working some realistic problems in the grey area between data aggregation and data reshaping.
`gapminder` data frame will be used to practice the data reshaping and table joins.



## Setup the working environment for the data analysis
Make sure `gapminder`, `tidyverse`, and `DT` packages are installed.
Load them with the following code:

```r
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(DT)
```

## Exercise 1: Univariate Data Reshaping

#### Exercise 1.1: Make a tibble with one row per **year**, and columns for **life expectancy** and **GDP per capita** for *Canada* and *United Kingdom*.

```r
gap_wider <- gapminder %>%
  filter(year, country=='Canada' | country =="United Kingdom")%>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols     = year, 
              names_from  = country, 
              values_from = lifeExp) %>%
  as_tibble()
print(gap_wider)
```

```
## # A tibble: 12 x 3
##     year Canada `United Kingdom`
##    <int>  <dbl>            <dbl>
##  1  1952   68.8             69.2

##  3  1962   71.3             70.8
##  4  1967   72.1             71.4
##  5  1972   72.9             72.0

## 10  1997   78.6             77.2
## 11  2002   79.8             78.5
## 12  2007   80.7             79.4
```


#### Exercise 1.2 Producing a scatterplot of life expectancy for *Canada* against *that of *United Kingdom*.



```r
gap_wider %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Canada, y=`United Kingdom`)) +
  geom_point(size=2, color='blue') +
  xlab("Canada Life Expectancy (years)") +
  ylab("Mexico Life Expectancy (years)" ) +
  ggtitle("Life Expectancy of Canada vs. United Kingdom")+
  theme_bw()
```

```r
gap_wider %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-year), names_to  = "country", values_to = "LifeExp") %>%
  DT::datatable()
```

## Exercise 3: Table Joins 

Read in the made-up wedding guestlist and email addresses using the following lines:


```r
guest <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/attend.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   party = col_double(),
##   name = col_character(),
##   meal_wedding = col_character(),
##   meal_brunch = col_character(),
##   attendance_wedding = col_character(),
##   attendance_brunch = col_character(),
##   attendance_golf = col_character()
## )
```

```r
email <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STAT545-UBC/Classroom/master/data/wedding/emails.csv")
```

```
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   guest = col_character(),
##   email = col_character()
## )
```

#### Exercise 3.1: For each guest in the guestlist (guest tibble), add a column for email address, which can be found in the email tibble.
